# FindMe
A web/mobile app that lets users locate nearby emergency services locations and report their needs and physical conditions during an event of natural disaster. 
Created and owned by Ryan Cheung and Ruimeng Pang.
## Mission Statement
The three digits telephone number '911' has been designated as a nationwide number that provides the public a fast and easy access to reach for emergency assistance. It is designed to handle a fair amount of calls at a given time. However, during an event of natural disaster, this communication network could be overwhelmed. This number would immediately pop up in the heads of people with concerns or in danger. At times like these, it is crucial that urgent emergencies receive priority attention. We understand that people could be desperate in finding out whether they are safe or who they could reach for help during natural disasters, therefore, we created this web and mobile application that allows people with concerns and/or suffering from less life-threatening situations to report their physical conditions and look-up emergency services locations, as well as real-time evacuation orders and alerts issued by the EmergencyInfoBC. We hope that this application could help alleviate the tension at the 911 call center and provide the public with crucial information about situations of the event.
